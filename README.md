# Parkinson-TDA-RMT-Spectral

This repository contains the implementation of the hybrid topological, spectral, and random matrix theory (RMT) framework 
for Parkinsonâ€™s disease voice classification. The approach integrates synthetic data generation and evaluation on real recordings.

##  Repository Structure
- `src/`: Python source files (main experiment, feature extraction, analysis)
- `notebooks/`: Exploratory and redundancy analyses
- `figures/`: Automatically generated figures
- `results/`: Cross-validation metrics
- `data/`: Placeholder for real and synthetic signal folders

##  Requirements
